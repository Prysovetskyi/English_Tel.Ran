my name is Jan, I have been working in the service sector for 12 years.
I started my work as a waiter in my student years, then i went to a bar and was a bartender working in cocktail bars and night clubs,
but over time I wanted to move to a management position and completed an internship as the manager of the establishment and worked as a manager in a cocktail bar
after some time I decided to start my own business and opened a cocktail bar with my partner
but unfortunately we had to close our cocktail bar due to the COVID19 pandemic, 
after the pandemic the world changed and I decided to radically change my life.
I have been interested in technology all my life, that's why I decided to start IT courses, 
I studied at the faculty of international management, so I am sure that the previous education and knowledge 
I gained in IT courses will help me get to know the world of IT.
I speak Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, German and English, so I think that knowing languages will help me start my way in IT
