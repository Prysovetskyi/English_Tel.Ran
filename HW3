1) You are an IT specialist giving feedback to a colleague who is not meeting project goals.
As a colleague does not make progress in the project or he has problems understanding 
what the team is doing at the development stage - then the team can discuss it together or the senior programmer gives tasks to the programmer
that he can handle, as a rule in companies there is a practice when a certain a day or a certain period to help the initial specialist get better. 
Also, the company can conclude a contract with the programmer - that they will train the programmer,
but then he will work for the company as long as necessary


2) You are a team lead giving feedback to your team member who is not taking initiative in their work. 
Ð†t is difficult for me to understand how people can not take the initiative to do what they want to do, 
in Germany the first six months are considered a trial period, during this period the employer can fire you because he does not like your work 
(you will also receive feedback as to why this happened) 
and the employee can also leave the company like he doesn't like their policies or the company's attitude towards him. Usually,
employees and the company who cannot find a common language work together for a certain time - the programmers do their work, 
the company transfers wages and everyone leaves


3) You are a project manager giving feedback to a colleague who is not meeting deadlines.
Since there was a problem with meeting the established deadlines, 
I believe that it is necessary to delay the time of testing or the time of program development until the product is 100% ready
Apple has postponed the release of the iPhone or other devices several times - in order to get a quality product as a final result


4) You can give me the feedback on our English classes :)

I am satisfied with the English lectures, I always leave a positive feedback in the questionnaire after the lecture, but unfortunately, 
I cannot devote much time to handing in the English homework on time, because I am 100% immersed in the preparation for the diploma.
I can leave only positive feedback about our lectures
