Dear Julia Smirnova,

I am writing to you on behalf of Julia Smirnova regarding our upcoming English class. I would like to inquire about two things:

 1) Is it possible for us to go over the technical aspects during our lecture?

 2) Could you please inform us about the topic of our next lecture?
 
 Homework: add a link to GitHub

Thank you for your time and assistance. We look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Yours sincerely

Jan Prysowecki
